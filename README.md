# Task-Disease-Prediction-Machine-Learning
 In this project, machine learning algorithms are implemented on a comprehensive Disease Prediction Dataset to accurately classify health conditions based on features extracted from patient medical records. By applying different algorithms such as Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, this initiative seeks to improve diagnostic accuracy.
 # Algorithm Used
 1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC):
It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in a dataset. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is used here to classify disease outcomes.

2.  Naive Bayes:
It is a probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features. This algorithm is particularly fast and well-suited for categorical data.

3. Random Forest:
It is an ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It handles both classification and regression tasks well.
